# Unit 1 Homework Assignment: FinTech Case Study

## Background

As a FinTech professional, it is critical to learn how FinTech companies start, evolve, and grow, and to be able to speak knowledgeably about the major players in the FinTech space. Even those in a highly technical role must stay abreast of what is happening in the business landscape, as many FinTech companies create tools and technologies that are then used by other companies.

One of the key methods used to conduct corporate analysis is the **case study**. Case studies are often 50–100 pages or more, but your task is to create a more focused case study that analyzes how a FinTech company is responding to the problems and needs of the FinTech domain it is in, and how it is using technology to solve a standing financial problem.

In this homework assignment, you will:

* Select a Fintech domain that interests you, and then choose a company or project within that domain.

* Research the domain and company.

* Write a detailed case study of the company.

* Upload your case study to your git repository.

This assignment will challenge you to polish your FinTech research skills by accessing reports, publications, and online resources that FinTech professionals use to evaluate the industry. It will also help you situate the techniques and technologies you will be mastering in this course––e.g., machine learning, Python, modeling, blockchain––within the real world of global FinTech. Finally, it will give you practice presenting and speaking about FinTech strategy and technology.

## Instructions

### 1. Choose a FinTech domain that you find relevant or interesting.


* Payments/Billing

* Capital Investment

* Investment Management

* Wealth Management

* Personal Finance/Deposits/Online Banking

### My company (Cash App) mostly fits into these 4 catagories the best.


### 2. Choose a company (or project) within  your chosen Fintech domain.

Use online research to identify the trends in your domain, and choose a company that is successful or otherwise interesting to you. For example, if you chose Wealth Management, you may want to look at online journals, periodicals, reports, and websites about the future of Wealth Management, or how FinTech is changing or disrupting Wealth Management.

* The company that worked best for me and that has taken personal finance to another level would be Cash App. I chose Cash App because it has revolutionized banking and investing, by allowing people easier access to stocks and crypto currencies by allowing people to buy any amount of the assests through partial-shares. They also made peer-peer sales easier than ever for the client.

### 3. Conduct your research, using the case study template as a guide.

We recommend that you use the case study template below in order to focus your research. You may lengthen, shorten, or––if necessary––remove sections from the template to accommodate the information available about your company.

**Note** If you have chosen a project within a larger company (such as the Apple Credit Card), you may want to focus your research on the origins and scope of the project rather than on the company itself.

# The BEST App; Cash App

# Overview and Origin

## Name of the Company

  * Cash App

  * Bob Lee (Hired by Jack onto 'Square' where he later created Cash App)
  * Jack Dorsey (Former CEO of Twitter)

## How did the idea for the company (or project) come about?

  * The creation of 'Square Cash' happened when Jacks good friend Jim recieved a glass order for $2,000 but he didn't have a way to accept the payment. This caused him to call up Jack and complain to him how his iphone could do everything but take a credit card payment. Resulting in them making the first 'Square'. This invention allowed people to swipe credit cards and take payments through their mobile device.

## How is the company funded? How much funding have they received?

  * The company is funded by three main factors,
               * Transaction fees
               * Cash App Cards
               * Selling Bitcoin
  * Cash Apps revenue in 2022 was $10.6 billion which was a 14% decline from 2021


# Business Activities:

## What specific financial problem is the company or project trying to solve?

  * Cash App is trying to make mobile peer-peer transactions and investing easier for the user.

## Who is the company's intended customer?  Is there any information about the market size of this set of customers?
What solution does this company offer that their competitors do not or cannot offer? (What is the unfair advantage they utilize?)

  * Cash Apps main intended customer would be mom and pop shops internationally.
  * Cash Apps invations help many mom and pop shops around the globe in many regions such as, North and South America, Asia, the Middle East, and so on.
  * Cash Apps offers an easy peer-peer paymnent system with low transactional fees.

## Which technologies are they currently using, and how are they implementing them? (This may take a little bit of sleuthing–– you may want to search the company’s engineering blog or use sites like Stackshare to find this information.)

  * Cash Apps "uses cutting-edge enccryption" and fraud detection technology this is connected to the users information and how their transaction can be tracked.
  * They use a GOOGLE Cloud AI storage system
  * Cash Apps also runs on NVIDIA's GPU systems 

# Landscape:

## What domain of the financial industry is the company in?

  * Cash Apps main domains would be;
              * Payments/billings,
              * Cryptocurrency,
              * and Personal Finance.

## What have been the major trends and innovations of this domain over the last 5-10 years?

  * Since the pandemic in 2020, digital bank account numbers rose from 68% in 2017 to 76% in 2023, in past years such as 2011 the percentage was only a small 51%. When the pandemic was occuring we optimized our non-contact payment systems, which led to an increase in online banking. (Forbes)

## What are the other major companies in this domain?

  * Last year in 2022, the most used financial app "was surprisingly PayPal"(fool.com).
  * Another competitor of theirs Zelle is connected with several banking services such as Wells Fargo, and have a really good fraud detection system.
  * Their other competitor 'Venmo' leans more toward the social-side with their feed feature, they also only have a 25 cent transaction fee when Cash Apps is 1.5% of the order. (Money.com)
  * But Cash App also has its investing features going for it, allowing you to invest easier with an easy interactive UI.

# Results

## What has been the business impact of this company so far?

  * 'Square Cash' has allowed mom and pop stores to be able to receive credit card payments easier than ever before by turning your cellphone into a payment machine. With their branch off company 'Cash App' they allowed users to invest in stocks and in Bitcoin with ease and in partial payments. They also gave users an easy way to send money P2P with low transactional fees.

## What are some of the core metrics that companies in this domain use to measure success? How is your company performing, based on these metrics?

  *Cash Apps main metric for success would be its user rate. Even it has seen a drop in the past years Cash App is still running really well. A reason why they've seen a deccrease in user rate is because they tend to encounter problems such as data breaches which make people less likely to bank with Cash App since there's extra risk.

## How is your company performing relative to competitors in the same domain?

  * With Cash App producing $10.6 billion in revenue I would say Cash App isn't doing to bad for itself, even though the company is down 14% from 2021. It might've not taken the place for most downloaded but it is definitly still making good profit.

# Recommendations

## If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer? (This could be something that a competitor offers, or use your imagination!)

  * Add a calendar feature which allows me to date and see my upcoming payments, incomes, and dividends.

## Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company?

  * It would allow users to map out their expenses and their incomes, they would be able to visualize their transactions through the calendar.

## What technologies would this additional product or service utilize?

  * It would add another icon to the bottom of the screen and it would just take some extra coding to generate the calendar.

## Why are these technologies appropriate for your solution?

  * They are appropriate because it would take a simple update to the app and wouldn't be too expensive or challenging for the company.
